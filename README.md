### Summary
Have you ever spent more time on your Friday night deciding WHERE to eat than you actually do eating? Me, too. Meet CodEATS.

CodEATs is a mobile-first application that quickly matches its users with a restaurant tailored to the userâ€™s mood. The user is able to filter nearby food search results by food category, price tolerance, restaurant rating preferences, and travel ease. After the user applies their settings, CodEATs provides the user with a selection of eating choices based on their choices and enables the user to launch GPS navigation straight from the search page and navigate to their selected restaurant.

### Example Search
* In the example search below, the user selects from a variety of food categories.
* The food categories were selected to help the user quickly narrow down the type of food they want.
* The user the chooses to use their geolocation to find food near them. They could also type in an address or city for their search instead.
* The user then selects a couple of additional option to refine their search.
* Lastly, a list of options meeting the user's search criteria is displayed.
